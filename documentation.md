Introduction

Project Background
The aim of this report is to display a pattern library. This is a collection of user interface design elements that would appear multiple times on a website, including Navigation, Buttons and Headers along with Footers to name a few. Pattern libraries can be expanded extensively to allow for further elements that may be implemented into a webpage. Essentially, these are reusable components that make up a webpage, focussing on how the components interact, the purpose for which they will be used, and additionally containing code. 

These are beneficial for all parties involved – developers are able to write less and better code, thus making the codebase better to work alongside. Website owners have one place where everything is contained on their website and the option to build additional pages will be made available by using the existing components; allowing quick creation and implementation. Finally, this will provide a constant user interface for the user, allowing for easier and further understanding through the navigation.

Project Aims

The aim of this project is to create a pattern library. This will be influenced by current trends in pattern library creation, drawing ideas and elements from how they are currently created and how they will work within a webpage. Samples will need to be created to provide examples of UI elements, to present to users what these elements are and how to use them, the user will then be able to insert the content into their own webpage.

Research

There are different methods that will allow creation of the pattern library which will be explored below.

Building the Pattern Library

Using a Tool

Exploration into current tools that would allow a pattern library to be created were discovered. There are open source softwares which allow this to be created, including styleguide.io and patternlab.io. Styleguide.io has real life pattern libraries of current webpages such as Lonely Planet and Codepen, which have been created and ‘bumped’ to this site. These are relevant because they help web developers understand and interact with the library created. Patternlab.io allows creation of the pattern library to be completed through the software itself, and is an easy-access software which is more accessible for users who may not have as deep an understanding of how to create CSS and HTML code. Templates, which are edited by the user, have been created within the software, providing an easy to use and fast method of creation. 

Self-Creation

This pattern library could be created by myself, allowing my own styling and method to be implemented into the design. This method will allow unique customization including colour schemes, chosen elements and layout. Creation by this method would allow further creativity to be explored and used.

Selected Method

The method that will be followed for creating our pattern library will be using a self-created output. As explained above this will allow the library to be laid out in a way that is appropriate for what is to be implemented, and this will be created using HTML and CSS. Using a tool is a useful method but considering, understanding how to navigate, correctly present and use the tools provided will only add to the time creating this pattern library. Creating myself felt a method which would be a quicker process.

Design Process Method

A methodology will need to be explored where the highest quality of work can be completed in a set timeframe - known as a Software Development Life Cycle. There are methods that adhere to this process like the Waterfall methodology. This is a method that requires tasks to be completed one at a time, with each being completed before the next task can begin, leading to no overlapping within the tasks. There are six phases undertaken for the completion of a Waterfall method within this project.
1.	Requirement Specifications – This must include the requirements of the system to be developed.
2.	System Design – From the previous phase, this follows on defining the hardware and system requirements and understanding the overall system architecture.
3.	Implementation – This is where the system can start in its development, starting the process small and in order of the tasks. When each task was completed it was then tested for its functionality, otherwise known as User Testing.
4.	Integration and Testing – All of the tasks are then compiled into a complete system after testing is done for each of these tasks, before the next task, the entire completed system is tested for faults or failures.
5.	Deployment of the System – Once testing is completed the library is then deployed online so that it can be used by consumers. This is a completed pattern library.
6.	Maintenance – Errors can occur throughout a pattern libraries lifecycle. These will mean that updates known as patches will need to be released to correct any previous issues faced. Throughout these patches, this can also lead to enhancements of the product as better versions are released, maintenance make sure these changes are completed for the consumer market. 

Testing - User Testing

As mentioned within the Implementation section of the above, User Testing will be used as a base of the pattern library. Its purpose in the creation of this pattern library is to develop an understanding of the needs of the user, and of the user’s knowledge on navigating the pattern library. Research will include whether users are able to complete the tasks without any issues and the amount of time a task takes to be completed, and then this research will be utilised by making changes that improve the user’s performance by considering their needs.

Pattern Library Testing 

A select group of individuals will test the pattern library throughout its development. For this, error testing will be conducted - for example, checking for incorrect links between pages, incorrect grammar, and incorrect spelling. The UI elements being created will be tested to ensure they work as described. Users throughout the process can add any feedback towards its function and design; this can be regarding colour schemes, fonts or sizing that have been used in the UI elements.

Document Testing

The published document will need to undergo testing, to make sure that each element is clearly explained, and that its purpose, its functionality, and its relevance to their own webpage is clearly explained. Feedback will be given by the user following the testing, detailing the usability of the pattern library, and about its suitability for purpose. 

Technical Testing

This testing will ensure the pattern library produced will remain at a high standard and that all elements implemented work as intended. As completed within the user testing, this ensures that any code samples will work correctly if the user is to choose to use them on their own website. This will entail checks into our HTML and our CSS coding to make sure these are both written correctly without any errors such as spelling mistakes to incorrect ID’s. 

Cross-Browser Testing

All of the elements created will need to work throughout all browsers, this can be completed by opening the pattern library on all browsers, to make sure consistency of appearance and function is maintained throughout these and that the elements created work on each. This will need to be completed as no fixes should need to be made upon publishing of the webpage.

Design, Planning, Experimentation and Implementation

Design 

The page must include:

•	A side navigation bar that clearly shows each page with a title. 

•	Pages to be correctly titled 

•	An example of the element on its page, with a complete explanation of what the element is, how it can be used and what purpose is it beneficial for.

•	The code samples to be displayed with the element, this would be alongside the HTML necessary for this element to be included onto another site.

UI Elements 

When designing the elements, a structure would need to be gathered and confirmed to decide how content will be shown. Being asked to produce six different button types, it was important to design beforehand. The process of designing these buttons was completed using trial and error to see how the buttons would be displayed and appear when interactable with the user. Using a software Sketch – a vector graphics editor – this would allow quick design processes as this is a software which I have confidence in using. 

Planning

It was essential that a layout was agreed on for the pattern library and this was completed by using Wireframe.cc to show how information was going to be displayed to the user, enabling understanding into how the user can follow the pattern library through its purpose. Consistency would have to be maintained through the layout. 
The wireframe below shows the layout that will be followed for the created project library on the homepage; as discussed earlier it will implement a side nav bar for navigation between pages. Throughout research this could be changed as it was early in the process of the pattern library. The wireframe lists ‘checkbox’ as an element to be created, but my pattern library instead utilises ‘pagination’ as it is a more accessible option.

Experimentation

Through this process it was decided the best way to layout the pattern library would be using a responsive grid structure, something which would be implemented using floats. The rows and columns created would give us a clear space to layout elements and the content provided. In previous studies, the responsive grids were twelve columns wide, percentages within the CSS would allow ‘cols’ to be set across a page. This process was time consuming but a twelve-column responsive grid was created and worked correctly allowing content to be laid out as intended. This would be the option selected for the pattern library.

Implementation

Responsive Grid

As discussed this was the best method of laying out the pattern library. Within the grid created there would need to be elements within that would allow correct implementation. Within our CSS coding ‘col’ would be used, drawing upon percentages so elements would only adhere to a certain sizing and placement on the pattern library. The tags ‘header’ and ‘footer’ would be stuck to their respective areas on the page, containing a title and social media links. The tag ‘section’ will be 100% In width across our pattern library with padding for the top and bottom.

Construction of Pattern Library

All completed elements will be shown below. HTML coding was used for the structure of the elements and this will be supported by the CSS coding which will style the colour and fonts of the elements.  

Buttons

Many designs of these buttons were created through Sketch and as aforementioned, six button types were created through the process of building, ensuring a range of suitable options within the pattern library and for use on other webpages. Buttons have been created in outline; this is for visual aesthetic when the button is selected. 

Header

Creating a static header was not the first choice through this process of the pattern library; a carousel was going to be made for this but this was unachievable due to not understanding how to work this alongside the JavaScript coding. This is why the static header was chosen instead. The header will span across the full width of the page this is due to setting its code to width: 100% and by setting the margin: 0 auto.

Footer

The footer would be created to feature one area text and social media icons. This could be expanded to allow the user to add additional columns into the footer. For the social media icons, these images would be sourced online for implementation to this element.

Navigation 

For the navigation element, a full width horizontal menu was created. This would allow the elements to be hovered over and when pressed it would provide a visual reminder to the user that they are on the correct page. This would be done by providing the element with an ‘.active’ class, giving it a darker colour when activated.

Jumbotron

A jumbotron helps to provide the user a cue, allowing some context into what they will need to do, for example ‘Place of Birth’ in an input box that when the user selects it will allow them to type, making the text disappear. Using a ‘placeholder’ text for our element, two input types are used – text and submit. 

Pagination
This is an element that is useful for a website with multiple pages, adding this will help easy navigation between this. Making the class “.active’ will highlight the current page and using ‘.hover’ will allow changes in colour of the page link when moving the mouse over them.

Conclusion

Understanding whether the pattern library did as it was created for was pivotal, this meant gathering some questions and conducting tests on a few subjects. From the results received it’s clear to see that the pattern library worked as intended and that each aspect was fully functional, with the only issues raised being suggestions for improvements of the aesthetic of the pattern library. These elements could be altered through patches in the future to further this.
